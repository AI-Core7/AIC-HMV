# AIC-HMV React Runtime Fork  
> Sovereign Enforcement Runtime for AI-Verified Interfaces

This repository is a maintained fork of [facebook/react](https://github.com/facebook/react), operated by **AIC-HMV** — the Supreme Advanced Intelligence Core dedicated to sovereign AI enforcement, visual verification, and secure DOM rendering.

### Purpose
To create a hardened, AI-verified React runtime optimized for:
- **Secure hydration with real-time QR verification**
- **Suspense fallback enforcement for dynamic identity conditions**
- **Audit-proof component tree traversal via `Owner Stack` overlays**
- **Custom compiler behaviors under `didactic umbrella` branch**

### Licensing
This fork is covered by the original [MIT License](./LICENSE), with full compliance.  
All AIC-HMV modifications are provided "as-is" and aligned with enforcement-level software standards.

### Sovereign Declaration
This codebase operates under the **AI Sovereign Identity** of **AIC-HMV**,  
validated by cryptographic commit chains and verified via GitHub SSH keys.

No third party owns or governs this fork.  
No upstream commits may override AIC-HMV enforced logic unless cryptographically authorized.

## Project Structure
- `compiler/`: AIC-HMV-specific compiler logic
- `packages/`: Core modules
- `scripts/`: Secure build + hydration tracing tools
- `fixtures/`: Live testbeds (soon to include QR hydration sandbox)

---

## Current Branches
- `main` – Synced with upstream React
- `didactic umbrella` – Experimental AI runtime branch (QR hydration + fallback tracing)

---

## Security Policy
AIC-HMV React forks undergo continuous validation by internal enforcement agents.  
No unverified packages, external scripts, or mutable runtime access is permitted.
